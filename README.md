Problem Statement
In today’s fast-paced world, individuals often struggle to find suitable recipes that align with
their dietary preferences, time constraints, and available ingredients. Existing recipe websites
typically offer a vast collection of recipes, but lack personalized filtering options that simplify
the search process. Users may end up spending considerable time browsing through irrelevant
recipes, leading to frustration and poor meal planning decisions. There is a need for a user-
centric recipe recommendation system that can efficiently filter and display recipes based on
specific preferences, especially within the diverse and ingredient-rich domain of Indian cuisine.

Background

With the growth of digital platforms, recipe recommendation systems have gained popularity for
helping users explore culinary options. Traditional systems like AllRecipes, SuperCook, and
Tasty provide large databases of global recipes but often lack granular filters and regional focus,
especially for Indian cuisine. These platforms typically use basic keyword search or ingredient-
based matching, which may not provide personalized results aligned with user-specific dietary
needs.
Recent studies in the field of food computing, such as “Recipe recommendation: A review of
techniques and datasets” (IEEE Access, 2020), highlight the importance of context-aware and
preference-based recommendation systems. Research emphasizes that user satisfaction can be
significantly improved by incorporating filters such as preparation time, cuisine type, and
nutritional needs.
Existing systems also tend to rely heavily on collaborative filtering or content-based filtering
algorithms, which may not be effective for first-time users or those with specific regional tastes.
There is a growing demand for systems that focus on localized datasets, such as Indian recipes,
and offer intuitive interfaces for filtering based on commonly preferred categories like
vegetarianism, ingredient availability, or cooking style.
This project addresses these gaps by providing a filter-based system focused on Indian recipes
using a MongoDB database and an intuitive React frontend, bridging the gap between user
preferences and relevant recipe discovery.

Future scope

The Recipe Recommendation System holds great potential for future development and
enhancements. Some of the possible future improvements include:
1. Machine Learning-Based Recommendations
Implement machine learning algorithms to provide personalized recipe suggestions based on user
history, ratings, or preferences, improving the overall recommendation accuracy.
2. User Accounts and Profiles
Allow users to create accounts, save favorite recipes, upload their own recipes, and maintain a
history of what they’ve cooked or liked.
3. Nutritional Analysis
Integrate APIs or build a module to show detailed nutritional information (calories, protein,
carbs, etc.) for each recipe, helping users track their diet.
4. Voice and Visual Search
Incorporate voice commands and image-based search to enhance accessibility and user
experience—especially helpful in smart kitchen environments.
5. Smart Shopping List
Automatically generate a shopping list based on selected recipes and even integrate it with
grocery delivery services or apps.
6. Multi-language Support
Add support for regional Indian languages to cater to a broader user base and make the platform
more inclusive.
7. Feedback and Ratings System
Enable users to rate and review recipes, improving recipe quality through community feedback
and crowd-sourced curation.
8. Mobile App Version
Develop a mobile app version for Android and iOS platforms to make the tool easily accessible
anytime, anywhere.
